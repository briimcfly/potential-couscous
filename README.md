An API for a social network web application built using Express.js, MongoDB, and the Mongoose ODM. 

## User Story

## Acceptance Criteria

`WHEN` I enter the command to invoke the application <br>
`THEN` my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database <br>
`WHEN` I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts <br>
`THEN` the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON <br>
`WHEN` I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia <br>
`THEN` I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database <br>
`WHEN` I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia <br>
`THEN` I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
